      'The Manhattan Project was the final project of my University of Washington Full-Stack Bootcamp that I completed in November 2019. It is a social network built around the ability to search for your favorite beers and cocktails. In addition to the search functionality it features user profiles with the ability to follow other users, rate and favorite products in the database, and post and vote on comments on those products. I implemented both a dark and a light theme for the site as well as created a component library that is used across the site.',
      'I worked on the majority of the front end of this site. I created most of the components that are used on the pages using the Styled-Components CSS-in-JS library, I was responsible for setting up the client-side router using React-Router-DOM, and I created the Profile page, the Edit User page, the Product Detail page, and the Landing page. I also was responsible for handling persistence between site visits, using Local Storage and Reactâ€™s Context API for App level state.',
      'We built the site with React and used TypeScript on both the front and back ends. I pushed for the use of TypeScript on this project because of the great developer experience it provides in addition to the static type checking. I felt much more confident over the month we spent creating this site because of the insight that TypeScript provides into the structure of the application. We caught almost all of our bugs in development, and only a minor few were able to sneak past us into production.'

We used React on the front end, leveraging the Styled Components  library for CSS in JS, which allows for dynamic and functional styling that I can pass props to. These purely stylistic components, are then easily called whenever needed throughout the rest of the site, making the design consistent to the user and easy to comprehend to the developer.',
      'As I was familiar with React at the start of this project I took it upon myself to create structure for our application. I created an a library of elements, utilities, and a few custom Hooks for us to use throughout the site to ease the burden of new technology on my counterparts, and helped my teammates learn how to use React on the fly. I also handled the more complex aspects of our client-side app, such as setting up the React Router.',

We agreed on a mobile first approach to ensure that the site would look good on screens of all sizes, and I helped my fellow front-end collaborator to learn and use the Sass CSS pre-processor. We agreed to use the BEM class naming convetion to remove the overhead of deciding what to call certain elements, as well as for its ease of use with Sass's nesting functionality.",

I found this project extremely challenging and it took my longer than any assignment throughout the Boot Camp to this point. To be precise, I had troubles grasping how I was to structure my database calls in conjunction with handling which user was which, and keeping track of users when one would leave the lobby. I am very pleased with how well the app came together in the end after how long I struggled with getting it to function.',

This is one of my favorite designs I have executed in my career; in particular I love the way the buttons change when one is hovered, and how the content cards change color every time the page is loaded. It is a simple design to be sure but the look of the project came together exactly how I pictured it in my mind.'
